# King Me Checkers Game

Checkers game was developed as part of Software Engineering course at Loyola University Chicago.

Allowed Modes:

1) One player (Human vs Computer)
2) Two player (Human vs Human locally)
3) Network play (Human vs Human remotely)

In order to get network play to work, both devices must be within the same subnet mask. Note that emulator won't be working for testing. 

For Artificial Intelligence, instead of looking at just one step, for each possible legal move the game will simulate for multiple steps , calculate the priority after the simulation and pick the move with highest priority.   

Rooms to improve: 
- Add automated test cases
- More elegant user interface
- More intelligent Artificial Intelligence
